<h2><a name="s1"></a>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
CellDiff is a Microsoft Office Excel add-in to compare cell contents.  See the screenshot below.

<h3><a name="s1.1"></a>1.1 Background</h3>
<p>
I wrote this program to facilitate document review process.
</p>
<p>
When I review some documents, I am often asked to write the review comments and suggested changes on an Excel sheet.
Such a form usually contains columns such as: line number, original sentence, suggested change, and comments.
The original author or a document editor reads the comments and decide whether to apply the suggested changes.
I believe it is a common practice.
</p>
<p>
If a change to a particular sentence is small, e.g., just a correction of a typo or two,
the original sentence and suggested change are almost same, 
and I often need to explain which letter I changed in the comment column.
I considered it is a waste of time, and created this small add-in to avoid it.
</p>
<h2><a name="s2"></a>2. How to use</h2>
<p>
On the Excel's ribbon, under the Review tab, you see a large command icon labeled Compare Cell Contents. 
(See the screenshot below.)
Select cells that contain texts you want to compare, then click on the Compare Cell Contents.
Contents of the sellected cells are compared, and the differences are emphasized.

<h3><a name="s2.1"></a>2.1 Using Compare Cell Contents</h3>
<p>
There are five ways to select cells for Compare Cell Contents:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Select two adjacent cells with a single mouse dragging.  This is the most basic way to use Compare Cell Contents.
Two cells may be adjacent horizontally (i.e., they are on a same row) or vertically (i.e., they are on a same column.)
</li>
<li>
Select several rows in two adjacent columns with a single mouse dragging, resulting a rectangular selection of width two.
Two cells on a same row will be compared in this case.
</li>
<li>
Select several columns in two adjacent rows with a single mouse dragging.  This is a swapped row-column version of the above.
Two cells on a same column will be compared in this case.
</li>
<li>
Select two non-adjacent cells, by clicking on the first cell and then control-clicking on the second cell.
Then, click on Compare Cell Contents.
</li>
<li>
Select two separate (non-adjacent) areas of cells.  This is usuful if you want to compare non-adjacent cells.
Select the first group of cells, as usual, with a single mouse dragging, then control-drag over the second group of cells.
This way, you can get two separate areas of cells selected.
Click on Compare Cell Contents, then.
Each cell in the first area are compared against a cell in the second area.
Note that the two areas should contain the same number of cells.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="s2.2"></a>2.2 Using Compare with Advanced Options</h3>
<p>
To the lower right of Compare Cell Contents command icon is a dialog box launcher symbol.

</div>
<p>
As other dialog box lancher symbols appearing elsewhere on the ribbon, 
when you click on it, 
a dialog box opens so that you can specify some detailed and/or advanced options when comparing cells.
With this dialog box, you can instruct CellDiff to behave differently than what you can get with Compare Cell Contents.
